Some notes from reasearching:

Difficult part of text classification is modelling the data (sparsity problems)?

Feature selection (TF, IDF, chi-squared, info gain, gain rate, essential word, odds ratio, ...)

SVM seems popular in general with either comparable performance in various metrics or excellent (some mention accuracy though it is not always the best, but tends to be bested by models which we do not use here)
